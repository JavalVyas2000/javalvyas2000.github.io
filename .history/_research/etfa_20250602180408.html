This project investigates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as autonomous agents capable of performing control tasks and handling faults in dynamic environments. Moving beyond static prompt-response roles, LLMs here are conceptualized as intelligent agents embedded in a multi-agent control loop, capable of monitoring plant conditions, issuing control commands, validating outcomes, and adapting strategies through reasoning.
</p>

<h2>Key Contributions</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>LLMs as Control Agents:</strong> The system leverages LLMs to act as real-time controllers, analyzing current sensor data and deciding control actions such as adjusting heater states in a thermoelectric system. These actions are then executed in simulation or on physical hardware.</li>

  <li><strong>LLMs as Fault Handling Operators:</strong> Inspired by industrial operator roles, the ETFA paper component demonstrates how LLMs can act during fault conditions — identifying abnormal behavior, proposing mitigation strategies, and steering the plant toward a safe recovery state.</li>

  <li><strong>Multi-Agent Framework:</strong> The architecture is structured around five intelligent agents:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Monitoring Agent:</strong> Observes system conditions, detects anomalies, and determines when to trigger fault handling.</li>
      <li><strong>Action Agent:</strong> Selects control commands based on goals, constraints, and system state.</li>
      <li><strong>Digital Twin:</strong> A simulation environment to verify and predict the effects of proposed actions.</li>
      <li><strong>Validation Agent:</strong> Evaluates simulated outcomes for constraint violations or unsafe behavior.</li>
      <li><strong>Reprompting Agent:</strong> Refines decisions through iterative reasoning when invalid outcomes are detected.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Physical Experiments with Temperature Control:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Relay Logic:</strong> Demonstrates simple temperature switching via on/off control.</li>
      <li><strong>Collaborative Control:</strong> Multiple LLM agents coordinate to maintain a setpoint temperature using reasoning and communication.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Fault Recovery Case Studies:</strong> In more advanced scenarios, the LLM operator adapts to simulated faults (e.g., blocked flow paths, sensor drift) by selecting alternate actions or constraints to keep the plant operational.</li>

  <li><strong>Challenges and Future Directions:</strong> The primary challenge remains inference latency and consistency. Ongoing work focuses on improving response times, incorporating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and fine-tuning strategies to reduce reprompting cycles.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The overarching goal is to establish whether foundation models can take on functional roles in autonomous control and fault mitigation — not just describing solutions, but enacting them through integrated reasoning, feedback, and execution.
