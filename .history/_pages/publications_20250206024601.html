        <h1>Optimization model and algorithms for the Unit Commitment problem</h1>
        <p>This paper presents a solution to the unit commitment problem by employing a decomposition method combined with the tight model from EGRET software, addressing its combinatorial complexity. Benchmark tests against four case studies demonstrate significant computational speedups without compromising solution quality. (Under review at ESCAPE-35)</p>
